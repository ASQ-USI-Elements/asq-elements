PARSING
1) we need to parse the questions and inject them to the db

SUBMISSION
1) viewer script should have an event listener for asq-exercise submit events
    * asq-exercise will emit an event after it has gathered all the submissions from the children
2) the viewer is going to submit this to the server
3) The server needs to know how to store the data of a question

FEEDBACK
1) we need to show to a student if his/her submission was correct (maybe this will introduce new elements like <asq-hint></asq-hint>)
2) stats

WHAT THE ABOVE MEAN FOR THE ELEMENTS
1) each element should have a schema definition
2) method to store a submission to the database
3) npm install asq-elements should install the server side code needed


viewer.js
//connect to the socket

// have an event listener for asq-exercise
document.addEventListener('asq-submit', function(evt, detail, sender){
  submission = detail.submision;
  socket.emit({submission: submission })
});
